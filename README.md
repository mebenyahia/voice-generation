Spaghetti and macaroni of scripts that allow you to clone pretty much anyone's voice given that you have a recording of their voice reading text.
It's pretty simple, + there are markdowns.

There is a demo of the generated voice samples on [buggy love button](https://lovebutton.onrender.com) and on my github: [the love repo](https://github.com/mebenyahia/lovebutton)

Thanks Neonbjb. Thanks Nanonomad. Thanks Thorsten-voice. Thanks librivox. Thanks google colab for enabling me to run stuff throughout the years without cramming my potato laptops.

The dataset I have created from the public domain on librivox: Jenn dataset, which is Jenn Broda's voice.
And the James dataset which used James R. Hedrick's voice. Feel free to use and re-use and use.
