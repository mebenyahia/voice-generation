Spaghetti and macaroni of scripts that allow you to clone pretty much anyone's voice given that you can create a dataset.
It's pretty simple, + there are markdowns. Thinking of it, I do miss spaghetti. 

Thanks Neonbjb. Thanks Nanonomad. Thanks Thorsten-voice.   

I've included the two datasets I have created from the public domain on librivox: Jenn dataset, which is Jenn Broda's voice.
And the James dataset which used James R. Hedrick's voice. Feel free to use and re-use and use.
